## Main goals of the project
- Create one that works like a real bank site
- Implement saving a user, adding money to a bank card, buying real estate, taking a loan
- Uploading real estate to the database

## Goals for me
- For me, first of all, a more in-depth study of html
- I used a parser in the project to get information about real estate
- Work a lot more with ORM
- More practice for yourself
